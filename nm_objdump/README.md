Some shit here you need to understand without guidance basically

Start with do `cat /usr/include/elf.h` or open it with vim

Then if you are really bored just copy this and move on.

Even the coach cannot do this, except show you how to type the commands, not how to build them. I am assured. So letâ€™s save time.
